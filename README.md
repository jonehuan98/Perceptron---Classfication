# Perceptron---Classfication

Requirements: Python 3.0 or later
Libraries used: Numpy and Pandas

To run this code, user must have files test.data and train.data in the same folder as the .py file.

The code is written to classify the three different classes in the data.

In the code, contains a perceptron class with two types of functions: fitting() and regularizedfitting().

To reproduce the results of binary classification and multiclass classification, fitting() should be used to train the perceptron weight and bias.
For regularised multiclass classification, regularizedfitting() should be used. The regularisation coefficients can be altered in the code.

For the calculation of accuracy, binary classification should use accuracy(), while multiclass and regularisation multiclass should use probability(), as these accuracies are calculated differently.
